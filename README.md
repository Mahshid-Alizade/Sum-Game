# Sum-Game
This is a simple implementation of "Sum" game done in "The Proteus" software tool.

# Conditions
The game is followed in such a way that the first two-digit number selected must be equal to the sum of two other two-digit numbers. 
So you will be able to choose three houses in each stage. 
The game starts from the player on the left and continues according to the turn and scoring discussed in the previous paragraph until the time of both players reaches zero. 
In the end, any player who has a higher score wins the game. 
In addition, another condition to win is to reach 10 points, and any player who reaches it first wins the game, and time will not matter anymore.
